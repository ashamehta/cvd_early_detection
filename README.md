# BMI210 Final Project

This script uses decision criteria designed for detection of early cardiac disease to identify cardiovascular disease in asymptomatic individuals, given the patient's risk factor history and various lab measurements, if needed.

Usage: `python3 early_detection_cvd.py`  
This script prompts the clinician user to provide up to three different sets of tests to the system over time. The correct data format of these test results can be found in the example csv files in `test_data`.
